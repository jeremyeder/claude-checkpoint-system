# Installing Claude Checkpoint System via CLAUDE.md

The Claude Checkpoint System can now be installed by simply adding instructions to your project's CLAUDE.md file. No scripts, no external dependencies - just copy and paste.

## Installation Steps

1. Add the following section to your project's CLAUDE.md file (create it if it doesn't exist):

```markdown
## Claude Checkpoint System

### ðŸš€ Bootstrap Instructions

If this is your first time working on this project, please set up the checkpoint system:

1. Check if CLAUDE_STATE.md exists
2. If not, create it with the template below
3. Replace [PROJECT_NAME] with the actual project name
4. Replace [DATE] with today's date

**CLAUDE_STATE.md template:**
```

Then include the full template content from CLAUDE_SELF_CONTAINED.md

## How It Works

When Claude reads your CLAUDE.md file:
1. It sees the checkpoint system instructions
2. It can create CLAUDE_STATE.md if needed
3. It follows the checkpoint process automatically
4. No external tools or scripts required

## Benefits

- **Zero Dependencies**: No install scripts needed
- **Self-Contained**: Everything in your project's CLAUDE.md
- **Portable**: Works in any project, any environment
- **Simple**: Just copy, paste, and start using
