## Installation Example

### 1. Install the System
```bash
# In your project directory
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeremyeder/claude-checkpoint-system/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### 2. Create Session Tracking Issue
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Issues â†’ New Issue
3. Select "Claude Code Session Tracker" template
4. Create the issue and keep it open

### 3. Update State File
Edit `CLAUDE_STATE.md` with your issue number:
```markdown
## ðŸ“Š Session Info
- **Session Issue:** #42  <!-- Your actual issue number -->
```

## Creating Your First Checkpoint

### Example 1: Feature Development Checkpoint
```markdown
## ðŸ”– Checkpoint: 2025-01-20 14:30

**Completed:**
- Implemented user authentication system
- Added JWT token generation
- Created login/logout endpoints

**In Progress:**
- Writing tests for auth endpoints
- Currently working on edge cases

**Next Steps:**
- Add password reset functionality
- Implement rate limiting
- Update API documentation

**Modified Files:**
- `src/auth/controller.js`
- `src/auth/middleware.js`
- `src/models/user.js`
- `tests/auth.test.js`
```

### Example 2: Bug Fix Checkpoint
```markdown
## ðŸ”– Checkpoint: 2025-01-20 16:45

**Completed:**
- Identified memory leak in WebSocket handler
- Fixed event listener cleanup
- Verified fix with memory profiler

**In Progress:**
- Running full test suite
- Monitoring production metrics

**Next Steps:**
- Deploy fix to staging
- Monitor for 24 hours
- Create regression test

**Modified Files:**
- `src/websocket/handler.js`
- `tests/websocket.test.js`
```

## Restoring Context

### Scenario: Starting a New Session
Tell Claude: "Restore context from checkpoint system"

Claude will then:
1. Read `CLAUDE_STATE.md` for current status
2. Check the session issue for recent checkpoints
3. Continue from where the last session ended

### Example State File Update
```markdown
# Claude Code Session State

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus
Implementing real-time notifications feature with WebSocket support

## ðŸ“Š Session Info
- **Started:** 2025-01-18
- **Last Updated:** 2025-01-20
- **Active Branch:** feature/notifications
- **Session Issue:** #42

## âœ… Completed Tasks
- WebSocket server setup
- Client connection handling
- Basic message broadcasting
- Authentication integration

## ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Implementing message persistence
- Adding retry logic for failed deliveries

## ðŸ“‹ TODO Queue
```
[ ] Add notification preferences
[ ] Implement notification grouping
[ ] Create admin dashboard
[ ] Write comprehensive tests
```
```

## Real-World Workflow

### Day 1: Project Setup
```bash
# Clone project
git clone https://github.com/yourname/yourproject
cd yourproject

# Install checkpoint system
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeremyeder/claude-checkpoint-system/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Create session issue on GitHub
# Update CLAUDE_STATE.md with issue number
```

### Day 2: Feature Development
1. Start Claude Code session
2. Tell Claude: "Restore context from checkpoint system"
3. Work on features
4. Create checkpoint before lunch:
```markdown
## ðŸ”– Checkpoint: 2025-01-21 12:00
**Completed:** Morning work summary...
```

### Day 3: Context Switch
1. Different developer takes over
2. They start Claude: "Restore context from checkpoint system"
3. Claude reads state and continues seamlessly
4. Developer adds their own checkpoints

### Best Practices Examples

#### Frequent Checkpoints
Create checkpoints:
- Every 2-3 hours of work
- Before switching tasks
- After completing features
- Before complex refactoring

#### Clear State Updates
Keep `CLAUDE_STATE.md` updated with:
- Current focus (one-line summary)
- Active branch name
- Blocker issues
- Next immediate steps

#### Descriptive Checkpoint Comments
Include:
- What was accomplished
- Any decisions made and why
- Problems encountered
- Specific files changed

## Troubleshooting Examples

### Lost Context Mid-Session
```
User: "I think you lost context. Please restore from checkpoint"
Claude: *Reads CLAUDE_STATE.md and session issue*
Claude: "I've restored context. You were working on [specific task] and had completed [X, Y, Z]..."
```

### Multiple Active Features
Use separate sections in TODO Queue:
```markdown
## ðŸ“‹ TODO Queue
### Feature: Notifications
[ ] Add sound preferences
[ ] Test mobile notifications

### Feature: User Profiles  
[ ] Add avatar upload
[ ] Implement privacy settings

### Bug Fixes
[ ] Fix date formatting (#38)
[ ] Resolve memory leak (#41)
```

### Team Collaboration
Add team context to checkpoints:
```markdown
## ðŸ”– Checkpoint: 2025-01-21 15:00
**For Team:** 
- API changes require frontend updates
- New environment variable needed: `NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_URL`
- Database migration required before deployment

**Completed:** ...
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Be Consistent**: Create checkpoints at regular intervals
2. **Be Specific**: Include file paths and function names
3. **Be Concise**: Focus on what matters for continuity
4. **Be Proactive**: Update state before issues arise
5. **Be Collaborative**: Write checkpoints others can understand

Remember: The goal is to minimize token usage while maintaining perfect continuity across sessions!
