# Self-Contained Claude Checkpoint System

## Overview

The Claude Checkpoint System can now be installed with **zero external dependencies** by simply adding instructions to your project's `CLAUDE.md` file. No scripts, no templates to copy - just add the instructions and it works.

## Quick Start

1. **Add to your CLAUDE.md**: Copy the checkpoint system section from [`templates/CLAUDE_SELF_CONTAINED.md`](templates/CLAUDE_SELF_CONTAINED.md)
2. **That's it!** Claude will automatically bootstrap the system when it reads your CLAUDE.md

## How It Works

When Claude reads a CLAUDE.md file with the checkpoint system instructions:

1. **Auto-Detection**: Claude checks if `CLAUDE_STATE.md` exists
2. **Bootstrap**: If not found, Claude creates it using the embedded template
3. **Customization**: Replaces placeholders with actual project information
4. **Ready to Use**: The checkpoint system is immediately active

## Example

See the working example in [`examples/demo-project/`](examples/demo-project/):
- [`CLAUDE.md`](examples/demo-project/CLAUDE.md) - Contains the self-contained checkpoint system
- [`CLAUDE_STATE.md`](examples/demo-project/CLAUDE_STATE.md) - Generated automatically when Claude reads the CLAUDE.md

## Benefits

- Works in any environment

### ✅ Self-Contained
- Everything needed is in your CLAUDE.md
- Portable across projects
- Version controlled with your code
- No external maintenance required

### ✅ Automatic Setup
- Claude handles the bootstrap process
- Replaces placeholders automatically
- Creates properly formatted files
- Works immediately

### ✅ Project Specific
- Automatically uses your project name
- Gets current branch information
- Sets today's date
- Customizes to your context

## Installation Options Comparison

| Method | Dependencies | Setup Steps | Maintenance |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | None | 1 (copy section) | None |
| Script Install | bash, git, templates | 3-4 steps | Update scripts |
| Manual | Templates | 5+ steps | Manual updates |

## Usage

Once installed in your CLAUDE.md:

1. **Start Sessions**: "Read CLAUDE.md and set up the checkpoint system"
2. **During Work**: Update CLAUDE_STATE.md with progress
3. **Recovery**: "Read CLAUDE_STATE.md and continue from the last checkpoint"

## Files

- [`templates/CLAUDE_SELF_CONTAINED.md`](templates/CLAUDE_SELF_CONTAINED.md) - Complete template to copy into your CLAUDE.md
- [`docs/CLAUDE_MD_INSTALL.md`](docs/CLAUDE_MD_INSTALL.md) - Detailed installation guide
- [`examples/demo-project/`](examples/demo-project/) - Working example

## Migration

Existing users can migrate by:
1. Adding the self-contained section to their CLAUDE.md
2. Keeping their existing CLAUDE_STATE.md (it will be used as-is)
3. No disruption to current workflows

This approach makes the Claude Checkpoint System accessible to any project with just a copy-paste operation.
