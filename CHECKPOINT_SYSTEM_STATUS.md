# Claude Checkpoint System - Development Status

## 🎯 What We Built
Created a token-efficient checkpoint/restore system for Claude Code that uses GitHub issues to avoid auto-compaction costs.

## 📁 Project Location
The complete checkpoint system has been moved to:
`/Users/jeder/repos/claude-checkpoint-system/`

## ✅ Completed
- Designed hybrid checkpoint approach (persistent issue + state file)
- Created all necessary templates and documentation
- Built automated installation script
- Organized into clean project structure
- Created git initialization script

## 📋 Remaining Tasks
- Initialize git repository in the checkpoint system directory
- Create GitHub repository
- Test the installation process on a sample project
- Create usage examples documentation

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. `cd /Users/jeder/repos/claude-checkpoint-system`
2. Run the git init script
3. Create GitHub repo and push
4. Test installation on a new project

## 📝 Key Files Created
- `README.md` - Main documentation
- `templates/` - All templates (issue, state file, CLAUDE.md snippet)
- `docs/` - Setup and anti-drift guides  
- `scripts/install.sh` - Automated installer
- `init-checkpoint-repo.sh` - Git initialization script (in current directory)
