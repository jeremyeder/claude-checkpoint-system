# Claude Code Session State

> This file tracks the current state of Claude Code sessions to enable quick context restoration without token-heavy auto-compaction.

## 🎯 Current Focus
Working on creating a checkpoint/restore system using GitHub issues to avoid auto-compaction token costs.

## 📊 Session Info
- **Started:** 2025-06-17
- **Last Updated:** 2025-06-17
- **Active Branch:** main
- **Session Issue:** [Create after first checkpoint]

## ✅ Completed Tasks
- Explored checkpoint/restore strategies
- Designed hybrid approach using persistent issue + state file

- Creating CLAUDE_STATE.md structure

## 📋 TODO Queue
```
[ ] Create first checkpoint as issue comment

```

## 🧠 Context & Decisions
- **Approach:** Using single persistent GitHub issue with checkpoint comments
